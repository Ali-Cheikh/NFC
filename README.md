# Understanding NFC Technology: A Developer's Guide  

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that many of us interact with daily—whether through Apple Pay for groceries, a key card for office access, or setting up a smart home device. But how does NFC work? What challenges do developers face during implementation, and how can they overcome them?

## What is NFC?  

NFC is a wireless communication technology that enables data exchange between devices in close proximity. It’s based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and uses a magnetic field to induce an electric current in nearby NFC-enabled devices.  

NFC is widely adopted across industries, powering contactless payments, public transport systems, access control, and smart home automation. NFC-enabled devices include smartphones, tablets, payment cards, and other gadgets with built-in NFC chips.  

### Benefits of NFC  

- **Ease of Use:** Intuitive for users.  
- **Speed:** Near-instant data exchange.  
- **Security:** Short-range communication adds a layer of safety.  
- **Versatility:** Supports diverse applications across industries.

## NFC Cards & Tags  

A common use of NFC involves tags or cards (PICC: Proximity Inductive Coupling Card) interacting with a reader (PCD: Proximity Coupling Device). These tags are typically battery-free, powered by the electromagnetic field of the reader.  

### Types of NFC Tags  

Tags differ in security and capabilities, depending on the application:  

- **NXP NTAG-Series:** Best for basic use cases.  
- **MIFARE® Family:** Ideal for secure access and payment.  
- **Sony FeliCa™:** Popular in Asia for transit and payment.  

All these tags adhere to the ISO14443 standard, defined by the **NFC Forum**, which also provides the **Data Exchange Format (NDEF)** for common use cases like storing URLs.

## NFC in Mobile Development  

To integrate NFC into mobile apps, developers can use SDKs like:  

- **Android NFC SDK**  
- **Apple Core NFC Framework**  

These SDKs support standards like NDEF, MIFARE®, and FeliCa™. On Android, **Host-based Card Emulation (HCE)** even allows smartphones to act as NFC cards. While iOS lacks this feature, developers can leverage the Wallet functionality for similar purposes.

## Common Challenges and Solutions  

### UI Differences (iOS vs. Android)  

Apple provides a standard NFC UI, but Android does not. To maintain consistent user experience, consider creating a custom UI on Android that mimics Apple’s flow and functionality.  

### Protection & Authentication  

The level of security depends on the use case and the tag used. For sensitive data:  

- **Read-only tags:** Prevent unauthorized edits.  
- **Password-protected tags:** Require authentication for edits.  
- **Advanced encryption (e.g., AES or DES):** Used in tags like MIFARE® DESFire® EV2.  

Avoid hardcoding keys in the app. Fetch keys from a backend and store them securely (e.g., iOS Keychain or Android Keystore).

### Communication Security  

By default, commands between PICC and PCD are sent in plaintext, making them susceptible to interception. To enhance security:  

- Use encryption (e.g., AES) for data transmission.  
- Validate data integrity with methods like **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**.

### Data Handling  

NFC data is often represented as byte arrays (hex or decimal). Here are some helpful functions for data conversion:  

```javascript
/**
 * Convert hex to decimal
 * @param hex - string
 * @returns number (0-255)
 */
export const hexToDec = (hex) => parseInt(hex, 16);

/**
 * Convert decimal to hex
 * @param value - number (0-255)
 * @returns hex - string
 */
export const decToHex = (value) => {
  const hex = value.toString(16).toUpperCase();
  return hex.length === 1 ? '0' + hex : hex;
};
